# Localizing Secretive

If you speak another language, and would like to help translate Secretive to support that language, we'd love your help!

## Getting Started

### Download Xcode

Download the latest version of Xcode (at minimum, Xcode 15) from [Apple](http://developer.apple.com/download/applications/).

### Clone Secretive

Clone Secretive using [these instructions from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

### Open Secretive

Open [Sources/Secretive.xcodeproj](Sources/Secretive.xcodeproj) in Xcode.

### Translate

Navigate to [Sources/Packages/Localizable.xcstrings](Sources/Packages/Localizable.xcstrings).

If your language already has an in-progress localization, select it from the list. If it isn't there, hit the "+" button and choose your language from the list.

Start translating! You'll see a list of english phrases, and a space to add a translation of your language.

### Create a Pull Request

Push your changes and open a pull request. 

### Handling Updates

When your translation is merged, I'll invite you to the [secretive-localizers](https://github.com/secretive-localizers) group. I'll tag this group anytime there's a new set of strings, in the hopes that you'll update the translation. If you don't want to be notified, feel free to decline the invitation or leave the organization at any time.

### Questions

Please open an issue if you have a question about translating the app. I'm more than happy to clarify any terms that are ambiguous or confusing. Thanks for contributing!
