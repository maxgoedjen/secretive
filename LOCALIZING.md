# Localizing Secretive

If you speak another language, and would like to help translate Secretive to support that language, we'd love your help!

## Getting Started

### Download Xcode

Download the latest version of Xcode (at minimum, Xcode 15) from [Apple](http://developer.apple.com/download/applications/)

### Clone Secretive

Clone Secretive using [these instructions from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

### Open Secretive

Open [Sources/Secretive.xcodeproj](Sources/Secretive.xcodeproj) in Xcode.

### Localize the Main App

Navigate to [Secretive/Localizable](Sources/Secretive/Localizable.xcstrings).

If your language already has an in-progress localization, select it from the list. If it isn't there, hit the "+" button and choose your language from the list.

Start translating! You'll see a list of english phrases, and a space to add a translation of your language.

### Localize SecretAgent

Navigate to [Secretive/Localizable](Sources/SecretiveAgent/Localizable.xcstrings).

Repeat the same steps from the process of localizing the main app.
