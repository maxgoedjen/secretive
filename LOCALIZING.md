# Localizing Secretive

If you speak another language, and would like to help translate Secretive to support that language, we'd love your help!

## Crowdin

[Secretive uses Crowdin for localization](https://crowdin.com/project/secretive/). Open the link and select your language to translate!

### Manual Translation

Crowdin is the easiest way to translate Secretive, but I'm happy to accept Pull Requests directly as well.

### Questions

Please open an issue if you have a question about translating the app. I'm more than happy to clarify any terms that are ambiguous or confusing. Thanks for contributing!

### Thank You

Thanks to all the folks who have contributed translations so far!

A special thanks to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) for their [generous support of open source projects](https://crowdin.com/page/open-source-project-setup-request).
